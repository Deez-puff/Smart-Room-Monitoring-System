# Smart-Room-Monitoring-System
Arduino-based system to monitor room temperature and humidity using DHT11 with LCD display and alert buzzer.

# Smart Room Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System

This project monitors room temperature and humidity using an Arduino UNO and DHT11 sensor.
The data is displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD and an alert buzzer is triggered when temperature exceeds a set limit.
