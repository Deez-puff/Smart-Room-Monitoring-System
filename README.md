# Smart Room Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System

A reliable and cost-effective **embedded systems project** that monitors **ambient temperature and humidity in real time** using an **Arduino UNO** and **DHT11 sensor**.  
The system provides **instant visual feedback** via a **16×2 I2C LCD** and **audible alerts** using a buzzer when temperature exceeds a predefined safety threshold.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The DHT11 sensor continuously measures temperature and humidity.
2. Arduino UNO reads and processes the sensor data.
3. The processed values are displayed on the LCD in real time.
4. If the temperature crosses a defined threshold:
   - The buzzer is activated as an alert.
   - An alert message is shown on the LCD.
5. All readings are sent to the Serial Monitor for monitoring and debugging.
